# Flashcard

A simple PWA to learn words for small kids.

You can try the app here : https://paulgreg.me/flashcard/ (but I strongly suggest you to host it yourself).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Settings

Before first run, copy `src/settings.json.dist` to `src/settings.json`.

By default, data is stored in localStorage.

If you want to save data online, you need to set `saveOnline` to true and update `saveUrl` to a service allowing to GET and POST json like [json-store](https://github.com/paulgreg/json-store).
